## Exploratory Data Analysis Hypotheses

### 1. Univariate Analysis

### 2. Does patients' length of stay (LOS) change with respect to `HOSPITAL_TYPE_CODE`?

### 3. Does patients' length of stay (LOS) change with respect to `CITY_CODE_HOSPITAL`?

### 4. Does patients' length of stay (LOS) change with respect to `HOSPITAL_REGION_CODE`?

### 5. `DEPARTMENT` of admission and its impact on LOS

### 6. `DEPARTMENT` X `HOSPITAL_REGION_CODE` and its impact on LOS

### 7. Does more `AVAILABLE_EXTRA_ROOMS_IN_HOSPITAL` impact a patients' LOS?

### 8. `TYPE_OF_ADMISSION` and its impact on LOS

### 9. `SEVERITY_OF_ILLNESS` and its impact on LOS

### 10. `AGE` and its impact on LOS

### 11. `ADMISSION_DEPOSIT` and its relation to LOS

### 12. Does more visitors come with patients who have more severe illness?

### 13. Is there any difference in the LOS for different `WARD_TYPE` & `WARD_FACILITY_CODE` in each `DEPARTMENT`?

### 14. Does `BED_GRADE` affect LOS of patients?

### 15. Does more visitors come when younger patients get admitted than the older patients?

### 16. What type of illness & admission does the majority of patients who are less than 30 years of age have, and which department are most of them getting admitted to?

### 17. Are patients below 40 years paying more `ADMISSION_DEPOSIT` when they get admitted to the hospital?
